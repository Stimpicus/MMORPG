# Faction and Mission Systems - README

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation of faction and mission systems for the MMORPG game. The implementation provides a modular, extensible framework for:

- Faction management and territory ownership
- Player employment rules based on faction affiliation
- Three distinct mission types (instanced PvE, open-world, instanced escort)
- Mission tracking and reward distribution

## Documentation

Three comprehensive guides are provided:

### 1. **QUICK_START.md** - Start here!
Quick reference for getting the systems up and running in your Unreal project. Includes:
- Step-by-step faction data asset creation
- Territory setup instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Common use cases

### 2. **FACTION_AND_MISSION_SYSTEMS.md** - Deep dive
Detailed documentation of all systems, including:
- Complete API reference
- Architecture explanations
- Integration examples
- Best practices

### 3. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Technical details
Technical implementation summary covering:
- Files created
- Requirements compliance
- Code quality notes
- Future extension points

## Quick Reference

### Faction System
- **UFactionDataAsset**: Data asset defining factions (Syndicate, Orange, Green, Blue)
- Create faction data assets in Unreal Editor (see QUICK_START.md)

### Territory System
- **ATerritoryActor**: Manages territory ownership and employment rules
- Place in levels and assign faction ownership

### Mission System
- **UMissionBase**: Abstract base class for all missions
- **UTerritoryClearingMission**: Instanced PvE (clear enemies)
- **UResourceCollectionMission**: Open-world (collect resources)
- **UTerritoryExpansionMission**: Instanced escort (protect convoy)
- **UMissionManager**: GameInstanceSubsystem for mission management

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Get the mission manager
UMissionManager* MissionManager = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UMissionManager>();

// Load faction and get territory
UFactionDataAsset* OrangeFaction = /* Load faction data asset */;
ATerritoryActor* Territory = /* Get territory from world */;

// Create and start a clearing mission
UMissionBase* Mission = MissionManager->CreateMission(
    UTerritoryClearingMission::StaticClass(),
    Territory,
    OrangeFaction
);

Mission->StartMission();

// Track progress
Cast<UTerritoryClearingMission>(Mission)->AddEnemyCleared();

// Check completion
if (Mission->GetMissionStatus() == EMissionStatus::Completed)
{
    int32 Reward = Mission->GetMissionReward(); // 1000 credits
}
```

## Key Features

✓ **Data-Driven**: Factions defined as Data Assets  
✓ **Extensible**: Easy to add new mission types  
✓ **Blueprint-Friendly**: All classes exposed to Blueprints  
✓ **Modular**: Ready for persistence and networking  
✓ **Well-Documented**: Three comprehensive guides  
✓ **Validated**: All code syntax validated  

## Implementation Status

All requirements from the problem statement have been met:

- [x] Faction data assets (Syndicate, Orange, Green, Blue)
- [x] Territory ownership logic
- [x] Player employment rules
- [x] Territory clearing missions (instanced PvE)
- [x] Resource collection missions (open-world)
- [x] Territory expansion missions (instanced escort)
- [x] Mission reward logic (1,000 credits)
- [x] Modular design for persistence and networking

## Next Steps

1. **Create faction data assets** in Unreal Editor (see QUICK_START.md)
2. **Place territory actors** in your levels
3. **Integrate with gameplay** systems
4. **Extend as needed** for your specific requirements
