# Faction and Mission Systems - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation provides a complete, modular faction and mission system for the MMORPG game as per the requirements.

### Core Components

#### 1. Faction System
- **UFactionDataAsset** - Data asset class for defining factions
  - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/FactionDataAsset.h`
  - Supports neutral faction (Syndicate) and competitor factions (Orange, Green, Blue)
  - Includes faction color, description, and reward multipliers
  - Blueprint-exposed for easy content creation

#### 2. Territory System  
- **ATerritoryActor** - Actor for territory management
  - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/TerritoryActor.h`
  - Tracks faction ownership
  - Enforces employment rules (players work in their faction's territories)
  - Special rule: Syndicate players can work anywhere

#### 3. Mission System

**Base Class:**
- **UMissionBase** - Abstract base class for all missions
  - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/MissionBase.h`
  - Fixed reward: 1,000 credits per mission
  - Mission status tracking (Available, Active, Completed, Failed)
  - Designed for future persistence and networking

**Mission Types:**

1. **UTerritoryClearingMission** - Instanced PvE
   - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/TerritoryClearingMission.h`
   - Clear enemies from territory instances
   - Tracks enemies cleared vs required
   - Auto-completes on objective completion

2. **UResourceCollectionMission** - Open World
   - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/ResourceCollectionMission.h`
   - Collect resources in non-instanced areas
   - Tracks resources collected
   - Configurable resource types and quantities

3. **UTerritoryExpansionMission** - Instanced Combat Escort
   - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/TerritoryExpansionMission.h`
   - Escort convoy through enemy territory
   - Tracks convoy health and checkpoints
   - Fails if convoy destroyed, completes on final checkpoint

**Management:**
- **UMissionManager** - GameInstanceSubsystem
  - Location: `Source/MMORPG/public/MissionManager.h`
  - Central mission creation and tracking
  - Mission filtering (active, available)
  - Reward distribution (stub implementation)

// Get subsystems and assets
UMissionManager* MissionManager = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UMissionManager>();
UFactionDataAsset* OrangeFaction = /* Load from content */;
ATerritoryActor* Territory = /* Get from world */;

// Create and test a clearing mission
UTerritoryClearingMission* Mission = Cast<UTerritoryClearingMission>(
    MissionManager->CreateMission(UTerritoryClearingMission::StaticClass(), Territory, OrangeFaction)
);

Mission->StartMission();
check(Mission->GetMissionStatus() == EMissionStatus::Active);

Mission->AddEnemyCleared();
// ... repeat until EnemiesToClear reached

check(Mission->GetMissionStatus() == EMissionStatus::Completed);
check(Mission->GetMissionReward() == 1000);
```

✅ **Minimal Changes:** Only adds new files, modifies one Build.cs file

## Usage Workflow

1. **Build Project:** Compile C++ code in Unreal Editor or IDE
2. **Create Blueprint Widgets:** Create UMG widgets inheriting from C++ classes
3. **Design UI:** Use UMG Designer to create visual layouts
4. **Bind Data:** Bind UI elements to exposed properties
5. **Extend Logic:** Override or call Blueprint-callable functions

## Next Steps (Future Work)

- Create Blueprint widgets from these C++ classes
- Design visual layouts in UMG
- Integrate with player character component/system
- Implement save/load persistence
- Add networking/replication support
- Hook up to actual game data sources
- Add UI animations and transitions
- Create HUD manager to organize all panels

## Testing Notes

Since Unreal Engine is not installed in this build environment, the code has been:
- ✅ Syntax checked for proper C++ structure
- ✅ Verified for proper includes and header guards
- ✅ Checked for Unreal Engine macro usage (UCLASS, UPROPERTY, UFUNCTION)
- ✅ Validated for proper file organization
- ⚠️ Full compilation requires Unreal Engine with UMG module

**To test:** Open the project in Unreal Editor 5.x and build the C++ solution.

Sword.WeaponName = "Iron Sword";
Sword.WeaponType = EWeaponType::Melee;
Sword.BaseDamage = 20.0f;
Character->EquipWeapon(Sword);

// Attack an enemy
Character->SetCurrentTarget(Enemy);
Character->PerformMeleeAttack();
```
